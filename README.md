# Welcome to my Web Developer Portfolio!

## About

Thank you for visiting my web developer portfolio! My name is Faith M. Roberts and I am a web developer with a passion for creating modern and responsive websites and applications. On this site, you will get to know my current level and a little bit about my background and experience.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio was built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was designed to be lightweight and fast, making it easy for visitors to browse through my work. Additionally, I used HTML and CSS for styling and layout, and implemented responsive design techniques to ensure that the site looks great on all devices which is still a work in progress.
